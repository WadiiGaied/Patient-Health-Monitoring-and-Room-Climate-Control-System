## Description
This project focuses on real-time health monitoring for patients, where each patient's health data is monitored within their room. Data from each patient is collected and transmitted to a central card using a communication protocol(CAN BUS). Once collected at the central card, the data is sent to a cloud server for analysis and storage. Additionally, a user interface (GUI) has been developed to visualize patient data in case of cloud server downtime. As a future enhancement, remote control of room climate via the GUI is being considered
